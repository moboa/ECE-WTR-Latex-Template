\section{Introduction}

This is the introduction.

\subsection{Subsection}

Some more text and a cross reference to \Cref{app:firstappx} and remember that one can lie about statistics \cite{liewithstat}.

\subsubsection{Sub-subsection}

% consistent figure numbering in the report body
This section will demonstrate figures.  \Cref{fig:wine} shows the result of storing a bottle of white wine for sixteen years.

% all figures have a number and title/caption below the figure
\begin{figure}[ht!] % h! means "here!" (instead of on top of the page)
    \centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{wine}
    \caption{16-year old white wine.}
    \label{fig:wine}
\end{figure}

The wine becomes deeper in colour going from a light yellow to golden.
\subsubsection{Another Sub-subsection}

% consistent table numbering in the report body
Some more text.  As a demonstration of tables, \Cref{tab:numbertable} demonstrates how certain types of entries should appear in a table.  Note that, in order to centre the numbers in the last column, three columns are given.

% tables have a number and title/caption above the table
\begin{table}[ht!] % h! means "here!" (instead of on top of the page)
    \caption{A table of numbers}
    \label{tab:numbertable}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l r c r l S[table-format=5.4]}
        % 4.4 means 4 digits before and after the decimal point
        
        \hline
              & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Integers}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Boolean}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Monetary}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Text}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Units (g/mL)}} \\

\subsection{A Third Subsection}

\section{Background}

% consistent table numbering in the report body
The background of the report.  As another example, \Cref{tab:anothernumbertable} displays another set of numbers, but are actually the same as \Cref{tab:numbertable}.

% tables have a number and title/caption above the table
\begin{table}[ht!]

\section{The Engineering Problem}

Some more text.

\section{Requirements, Criteria, and Metrics}

% add when necessary
\label{sec:rcm} % a label for "requirement, criteria, and metrics"

A list of the requirements, criteria and metrics that will be used in this report together with a discussion on any issues surrounding the selection of these.

This is an example of an inline equation: the formula $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}$ is often taught in first year.  The integral, however, is slightly less, as is shown by the display equation

\begin{center}
    $\int\limits_{1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x^{2}}\, \mathrm{d}x=1$.
\end{center}

This is of course centred.

\section{Possible Solutions}

Equations can be numbered, for example, it may be necessary to refer to

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:newtonssecondlaw}
    F=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(m\mathbf{v}),
\end{equation}

that is, Newton\textquoteright s second law, elsewhere in the document.  Cut-and-paste this table if you require an equation elsewhere.

\subsection{Solution 1}

A description and discussion of solution 1 and a reference to \cref{eq:newtonssecondlaw}.

\subsection{Solution 2}

A description and discussion of solution 2.

\subsection{Solution 3}

A description and discussion of solution 3 and so on.

\section{Engineering Analysis}

The analysis of the solutions based on the requirements and criteria listed above based on the metrics listed in \Cref{sec:rcm} on \cpageref{sec:rcm}

\section*{Conclusions}

From the analysis in the report body, it was concluded that...
